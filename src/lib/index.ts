		overview:
			'The goal of this project was to build a clean, aesthetically appealing personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional experiences. I focused on creating a user-friendly and visually engaging platform that highlights my expertise as a web developer, using modern design principles and smooth, responsive layouts.',

		planningDescriptions: [
			"When designing my personal website, I start by prototyping. This involves selecting the color scheme, defining the page structure, and creating initial layouts, which you can see in the image carousel below. Once the design is set, I begin development by focusing on a specific screen size. I create all the pages based on that size, ensuring the design aligns with my vision. If it doesnâ€™t, I revisit Figma for further adjustmentsâ€”there were quite a few iterations along the way! ðŸ˜… Once I'm satisfied with the design, I proceed to make it responsive across major screen sizes: 370px, 450px, 640px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px, 1536px, and 1972px. This approach ensures a consistent and polished experience across all devices."

			'One of the main challenges was making the website fully responsive across all devices. I tackled this by using flexible CSS grids and media queries to ensure a consistent layout on different screen sizes. Another issue was optimizing image loading for a better user experience, which I resolved by using image compression and lazy loading techniques.'
		],
		summary:
			'Building my personal portfolio website was an exciting journey that helped me refine my skills in design and development. I learned a lot about Svelte, Figma, responsive design, and performance optimization. Moving forward, I plan to consistently update and improve the existing project pages with more detailed descriptions.',

The focus was on building a clean, user-friendly interface that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks seamlessly. The application demonstrates full CRUD functionality and uses a responsive design to ensure usability across devices.',

			'Similar to many of my other web development projects, I usually start with the theme, and structure of the application. This is generated using Figma, which I am still learning how to use. For this project, I had a initial design idea, however, as I was developing and implementing it, it did not look as great. Therefore there is a slight change in design structure in the final design, which can be seen in the demo.'

			'One major challenge I encountered was my limited understanding of the Context API in React. Initially, managing state across components was difficult, as I struggled to grasp the best practices for efficient state management. Through research and experimentation, I was able to implement the Context API, which significantly improved the way state was shared across components.',
			"Another significant hurdle was designing a user-friendly interface for mobile screens. The initial layout didn't adapt well to smaller devices, so I had to rethink my approach using CSS Flexbox and media queries. This involved careful consideration of how elements should reflow on different screen sizes to ensure a seamless experience.",
			"Lastly, the app's initial design didnâ€™t turn out as expected. The original vision didn't align with the functionality and user experience I wanted to achieve, so I made the tough decision to redesign it. This experience taught me the importance of flexibility in design and that sometimes, starting over is necessary to create a product that truly meets user needs."

With features like transaction management, budget tracking, and customizable categories, it provides a solution for managing personal finances. The application also supports secure user authentication to ensure data privacy and protection.',

			'Unlike many of my other projects, this time I sat down and really highlighted what features of the application I could like to be able to complete. This is so that I will not be stuck in a cycle of trying to make the application perfect, but rather scope out the project and complete that. Therefore, I started out with writing the user stories, which highlights a lot of the CRUD functions for income, expense, budget, categories, etc.',
			"Then, I moved onto doing design research. This process is usually taxing, as there are so many different inspiration online. Eventually, I started designing and coming up designs as I go. There were, many things that worked and didn't work, which is why it takes quite a while to design the structure of the website. But eventually, I came up with the design, as seen in the image carousel.",
			'Lastly, I had to choose which tech stack that I want to develop with. I have noticed, that I am quite unfamiliar with Nextjs and, have not used MySQL in a while. So, I challenged myself to work with this stack.'

			"A big challenge of this application, was the authentication, specifically protecting the routes. Although, I have done this in my To-Do-List app it checked the tokens on every page load causing a little bit of repetitive code. While for this application, I wanted to make use of the middleware, to check the application for valid tokens whenever the user navigates to specified pages. However, I thought the middleware.ts file had to be in the 'root' of a nextjs project, which was incorrect. So, I was stuck in the cycle of trying to make it work at the 'root' of the project, when that is not even possible. I finally realised that it was supposed to go in the root of '/src'.",
